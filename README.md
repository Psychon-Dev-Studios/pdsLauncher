# pdsLauncher

This repository is a web-accessible resource API, used by the PDS Launcher and Installer to get the latest versions of all files and games. It allows anyone with internet access to get the latest features for everything easily.

Note: after uploading new files, it can take up to five minutes for the new versions of files to be deployed to the API server. You can check the status on the Deployments page.
